# TimeSeries-On-Energy-Consumption
The availability of energy has transformed the course of humanity over the last few centuries. Not only have new sources of energy been unlocked – first fossil fuels, followed by a diversification to nuclear, hydropower and now other renewable technologies – but also in the quantity we can produce and consume.

This project studied and predicted a future energy consumption of 2019 from a dataset having power consumption dated 2002 - 2018.
